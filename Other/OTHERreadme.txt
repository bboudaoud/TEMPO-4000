This sub-section includes two documents, the first is my Master's thesis from UVa including more detailed information about all of the sytem-level design decisions and test platforms used in the process of creating the TEMPO 4 platform. The second is a simple guide for interfacing MMC via SPI that I pieced together from a variety of sources when I was porting/writing the MMC base for this project. Both documents are not critical to understand the TEMPO 4 platform but may help with understanding the finer points of why certain decisions were made.

The final document in this sub-directory is a simple power calculator used to help determine some of the critical operating constraints and expected battery life for the TEMPO 4 system. This model is referenced several times in my Master's work and can help future designers to predict the impact of new system components on overall battery life and power budget. As with all things there is certainly room for improvement in this model, and I welcome any and all suggestions as to how this admittedly crude effort could be improved. In regard to model parameters, nearly all system currents (w/ the exception of trivial components such as current limited LEDs) were measured on the bench to validate data-sheet claims. If a new device is to be added to the model it is recommended that bench-top measurements are used to validate any claims related to specific peak current consumption or time of current draw, as seen from inside the regulator.
